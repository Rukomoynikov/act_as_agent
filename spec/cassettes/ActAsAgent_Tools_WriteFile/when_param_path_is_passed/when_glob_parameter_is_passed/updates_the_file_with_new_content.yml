        present in this moment. Our present experiences build the foundation for our
        future.\n\n2. **Uncertainty is natural**: No one can be completely sure about
        the future, and that''s okay. Accepting uncertainty as part of life can actually
        reduce anxiety about it.\n\n3. **Focus on what you can control**: While you
        can''t predict or control everything about the future, you can take small,
        positive actions today that align with your values and goals.\n\n4. **Trust
        in your resilience**: You''ve made it through challenges before, and the fact
        that you feel good now shows you have the capacity to navigate whatever comes.\n\n5.
        **Balance planning with flexibility**: It''s good to have goals and plans,
        but stay open to adjusting them as life unfolds.\n\nRemember: Feeling good

        values and goals.\n\n4. Trust in your resilience: You''ve made it through
        challenges before, and the fact that you feel good now shows you have the
        capacity to navigate whatever comes.\n\n5. Balance planning with flexibility:
        It''s good to have goals and plans, but stay open to adjusting them as life
        unfolds.\n\nRemember: Feeling good now is a strength to build from, not something
        diminished by future uncertainty. Use your current positive state as energy
        to take meaningful steps forward, one day at a time.\n"}]}],"max_tokens":1024,"stream":false,"temperature":1.0,"tools":[{"name":"ActAsAgent__Tools__ListFiles","description":"List
